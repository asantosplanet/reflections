When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I am working in a project with more people and we have to share changes and also as a security issue to have code duplicated in case something happens with your local repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository? 
Because I don't want to appear all changes, only them that make sense
