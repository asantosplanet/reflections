When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I am working in a project with more people and we have to share changes and also as a security issue to have code duplicated in case something happens with your local repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository? 
Because I don't want to appear all changes, only them that make sense

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are clones of other authors' repositories and they only exist in GitHub. Clones are copies of repositories whenever you want and branches are paths of your code that separates for some reason and maybe they merge in the future.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You can continue the work on the local branch and you are quickly updated
