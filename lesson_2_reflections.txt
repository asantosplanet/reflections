	Because I want to hace control version system in all files that are in the repository

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	Staging area is an intermediate area between working directory and repository, it is useful because you can aglutinate changes to do commits in groups and other issues.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	Checking if I have changes that I haven't commited yet and checking if this changes are important to commit separately
